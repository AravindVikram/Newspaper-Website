        <h2> Ex-Disney employee says she is still in denial about losing her job, calls the company her dream workplace. </h2><br>
        
        <p>
            Expressing herself on LinkedIn, Jeanette said that Disney is her 'dream workplace' and that she is still in denial about losing her job. She then thanked her former colleagues and reminicised in brief about her time at the organisation.
            She wrote, "Im still in denial about it as I write this. Disney is my dream workplace. As a cast member, I am proud to be a part of it and love when asked “Where do you make magic at?” My answer was Disney Streaming Advanced Research, an amazing, talented group of people building innovative, cool products. I am proud and beyond grateful to have landed within this group. Unfortunately, my entire department has been impacted by the #disneylayoffs and my Disney journey must come to an end. I mainly want to thank my team and everyone I had worked with. The project and team was beyond anything I can imagine. I learned so much and had the best time doing it. It's been a fun ride."
            Talking about her future plans, she added, "As I begin to regroup and take a moment to process whats next for me, if you see any roles that would be a good fit for my background as a front end engineer, please let me know. It will be much appreciated.
            <br>The layoffs at Disney were announced by te company's CEO, Robert Iger, during a call with analysts. While announcing the tough decision, he had said, "I do not make this decision lightly. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide," He also announced his decision of "targeting $5.5 billion of cost savings across the company". The CEO then added that the cost-cutting and reduced workforce count will help in achieving his goal.
            "Our priority is the enduring growth and profitability of our streaming business," Iger continued further and said that the company's forecast indicates that 'Disney Plus will hit profitability by the end of fiscal 2024'
            Disney announced its decision to lay off around 7,000 employees in February this year. Last month, it was reported that around 4,000 people (as part of the already mentioned 7,000) will be losing their jobs soon and that managers had been asked to prepare a list of candidates that are to be sacked. Since then, a lot of employees have shared their side of the story on LinkedIn and are looking for new opportunities. One such employee is Jeanette L, who was working with the company as a Senior Software Engineer since February 2021 until her role came to a sudden stop.
