        <h2>India likely to get 'below normal' monsoon rains in 2023 as El-Nino plays villain</h2> <br>
        
        <p>
            India is likely to receive below-normal monsoon rains in 2023 as the climate phenomenon El Nino takes over. Private weather agency Skymet has predicted that there is an increasing likelihood of El-Nino in Asia, which could become a dominant category during the monsoon.
            The weather agency predicted that the monsoon in 2023 will be below normal at 868.6 mm for the four-month-long period from June to September. "Skymet expects the upcoming monsoon to be 'below normal to the tune of 94 per cent of the long period average," the agency said.
            "The likelihood of El Nino is increasing and its probability of becoming a dominant category during the monsoon is growing large. El-Nino return may presage a weaker monsoon," the agency said in a statement.

            El Nino or El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation is characterized by a warming of the sea surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It occurs every two to seven years, and it has the potential to disrupt weather patterns around the world, including in India.
            According to the US-based National Weather Service, the surface waters across a large swath of the tropical Pacific Ocean warm or cool by anywhere from 1 degree Celsius to 3 degrees Celsius, compared to normal. This oscillating warming and cooling pattern are referred to as the ENSO cycle, which directly affects rainfall distribution in the tropics.
            The impact of the climatic phenomenon can vary depending on the severity of El Nino. It is associated with reduced rainfall in India, particularly in the southern and western regions, which can lead to drought conditions. This can have a significant impact on agriculture, as many farmers rely on monsoon rains to grow their crops.
            Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, known as the agricultural bowl of North India, are likely to observe less than normal rains during the 2nd half of the season, the weather forecaster said. Unseasonal rains and hailstorms have already damaged the ripening, winter-planted crops such as wheat in India's fertile northern, central, and western plains, exposing thousands of farmers to losses.
            Meanwhile, El Nino can also bring above-average rainfall to some parts of India, such as the northeast, which can lead to flooding and landslides. The worst impact of El-Nino on India was seen in 2009-2010 when it led to a severe drought in the southern and western regions as it significantly delayed the rains.
